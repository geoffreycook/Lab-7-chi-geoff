Getting the gc_df.csv data, loading tidyverse, and getting some summary counts

```{r}
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>%  #allows you to use the key value pair to convert levels that exist in one column to another column
  select(-gender)

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female", "Male")
```
